# SCOREC-base64
Base64 encoder/decoder for SCOREC's visualization files. 

This code will be later integrated into SCOREC's Core repository, a set of C/C++ libraries for unstructured mesh simulations on supercomputers.

It is based on the [Base64 Encoding Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64).
