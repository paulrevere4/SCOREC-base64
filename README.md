# SCOREC-base64
Pure `c++` Base64 encoder/decoder originally written for SCOREC's visualization files. It depends only on `std::string` so it can be easily brought into any project.

This code is now a part of [SCOREC's Core repository](https://github.com/SCOREC/core), a set of C/C++ libraries for unstructured mesh simulations on supercomputers.

It is based on the [Base64 Encoding Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64).
